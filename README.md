BiBall is a game that tests the performance of your PC using balls!

(Note: OBS Studio was lagging behind while recording ðŸ’€)

*Gameplay experiences do not appear in a transparent window at the right of the screen.

**<span style="color: red;">YOU MUST OPEN IT LIKE THIS TO SEE YOUR RESULTS.</span>** Run it from the Command Line to see logs, and your results are stored in the logs.

### Keybinds for BiBall

When you hold down a key, you'll see a number at the top-left, that number will be referred to as *x* in explanation.
(For example, if the counter reaches 123 before you let go of the key, *x* would equal 123.)

**ARROW KEYS**: All of the balls will be thrusted *x* pixels in the direction of the arrow key.
**SPACE**: Spawn 1 ball.
**ENTER**: Spawn *x* balls.
**R**: Reset simulation and show scores.
**ESCAPE**: Quit game and show scores.

**NOTE**: Creating balls is also an automatic process, so **SPACE** and **ENTER** aren't necessary outside situations of fun.

### Known Bugs

A lot of balls do generate before your results are sent, this is because... well idk python being slow ig???

This doesn't really count as a bug, but, downloading the .exe version of BiBall triggers SmartScreen, Google Chrome, and other browsers.


(i think this has to be my first repo that isn't related to cm2 and is coded in python lol)
